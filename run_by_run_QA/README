### R-BY-R QA PACKAGE DEVELOPED BY FUDAN-BNL GROUP FOR ISOBAR DATA ANALYSIS
### ANY QUESTIONS ON THIS CODE ARE WELCOME TO ASK Y. HU, P. TRIBEDY, S. CHOUDHURY, FEB 12, 2020 
### LAST EDIT ON MAR 30, 2020

TO RUN THIS CODE, YOU NEED THE FOLLOWING FILES: 
   runbyrun_advanced.sh
   jumpcheck.sh
   readoutroot.C
   badrunfinder.sh
   readoutdata.C
   readoutnrms.C
   qa.list	
   *runbyrun.sh		#Out of use, but you still could use this one if you only want to check one quantity 


TO RUN THIS CODE, YOU NEED TO GIVE THE ROOT FILE AND TPROFILE NAME
   bash runbyrun_advanced.sh [FILENAME] [NAMELIST]
 e.g:  bash runbyrun_advanced.sh 27gev_qahist.root qa.list
 *The qa.list in this package is the example for [NAMELIST] 


BY DEFAULT THIS CODE WILL HELP YOU CHECK HOW MANY TIMES OF WEIGHTED-ERROR TO DETERMINED JUMPS.
(5 TIMES AND 1% DIFFERENT AT LEAST)
(YOU CAN ALSO SET A FIXED NUMBER FOR HOW MANY TIMES WEIGHTED-ERROR BY HAND)

THIS CODE WILL AUTO DO THE FOLLOING STEPS: 
     STEP-1: Precheck the jumps without any cut
     STEP-2: 1st round BADRUNS check with 10-RMS
     STEP-3: Remove the 1st round BADRUNS and check the jumps
     STEP-4: Recheck every region in STEP-3 to avoid missing jumps
     STEP-5: Strict BADRUNS check with 5-RMS limit
  After find the jumps, it will check the next quantity:
     STEP-6: For every region given in the last step, check with the next quantity
     STEP-7: Repeat STEP-7 until finish the qa.list
      

THIS CODE WILL HAVE THE FOLLOWING OUTPUT FILES:
     Final_region_${HISTNAME}.list			#SAVE THE JUMPS 
     badrunlist_${HISTNAME}_10SIGMA.list		#SAVE THE 1ST ROUND BADRUNS
     badrunlist_${HISTNAME}_5SIGMA.list			#SAVE THE 2ND ROUND BADRUNS

     Final_badruns.list					#THE FINAL BADRUNS FOR ALL QUANTITIES 
     Final_regions.list					#THE FINAL REGIONS FOR ALL QUANTITIES 

THIS CODE ALSO HAVE AN ADVANCED MODE, YOU CAN CHOOSE:
    1.[NSIGMA_JUMP]
	 HOW MANY WEIGHTED-ERROR TO DETERMINED JUMPS  
    2.[NSIGMA_BADRUNS_0]
	 HOW MANY RMS TO REJECT THE 1ST ROUND BADRUNS (DEFAULT IS 10)  
    3.[NSIGMA_BADRUNS_1]
	 HOW MANY RMS TO REJECT THE 2ND ROUND BADRUNS (DEFAULT IS 5)
    
    TO RUN IT IN THIS MODE, YOU NEED TO GIVE 3 MORE PARAMETERS 
       bash runbyrun_advanced.sh [FILENAME] [NAMELIST] [NSIGMA_JUMP] [NSIGMA_BADRUNS_0] [NSIGMA_BADRUNS_1]
        e.g:  bash runbyrun_advanced.sh 27gev_qahist.root  qa.list 5 10 5
